This is a demo of the possible ways for letting a user reorder a list view.

There are three possible ways:
Drag & Drop (Multiple items can be selected using [Ctrl]+[left click]).
Clicking Buttons (Up/Down) 
Shortcuts ([Ctrl]+[Up arrow]/ [Ctrl]+[Down arrow])

Items can be renamed either by pressing [F2] or by double-clicking.
